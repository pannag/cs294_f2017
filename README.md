# cs294_f2017

My solutions to Berkeley CS294 Fall 2017 course on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

So far I have uploaded solutions to deep Q-learning and Policy gradient problem sets.
I have solutions to the Value / policy iterations and Dagger problems sets from Spring 2017.
I need to map them back to the Fall 2017 course.
